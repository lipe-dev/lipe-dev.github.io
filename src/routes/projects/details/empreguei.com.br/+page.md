# About the project

Empreguei.com.br was a company that provided job matching features for employers and employees.

Candidates could download the mobile APP and apply to jobs in a Tinder-like interface, by quickly swiping left or right.

Companies would access their own app for posting jobs or do it via the web-app.

# Challenges

The biggest challenge, by far, was developing the matching algorithm, which took into consideration candidates and jobs' locations, salary ranges, requirements, and other variables. This algorithm was constantly improved upon as more users joined, in order to keep up with the new data set.

It wasn't a simple matter of filtering them based on values, we developed a machine learning model that would rank all candidates possible matches based on those features.

Another big challenge was coordinating real time communication between the 3 different apps, specially after the match occurred when a chat would open up.

The chat was very feature rich, employers could employ automated interviews, with a pre set of questions that took many forms, including: questions where you answer by recording a voice clip or video, multiple choice questions that the candidate could answer from within the chat interface, free text questions, and more. However, the chat was also a regular real-time chat, in case employers found that to be more useful depending on the candidate.

# Learnings

This project was my first contact with many of the technologies I still work with today, including: React, Python, Django, Material Design, and Firebase.

Aside from learning and getting proficient in all of that, I also learned a lot about the business side of things, as I was the only developer in the company for a long time, and had to work closely with the CEO and CTO to make sure we were on the right track.

This was also the first time I worked with a machine learning model, and I learned a lot about how to train and improve it over time. I also learned a lot about continuous integration and deployment, as we had a very robust CI/CD pipeline that would deploy to production multiple times a day.

Sadly, the biggest teaching of all was that sometimes, even if you have a great product, a great team, and a great idea, and the best of intentions (finding jobs for people who need it) things don't work out. The company was shut down after a few years of operation.

# Final Thoughts

This was a great project to work on, and I am very proud of what we accomplished. I learned a lot and I am very grateful for the opportunity.

I wish the best of luck to my former colleagues and I hope we can work together again in the future!
