# About the project

My time at Giphy was short lived, but I had the opportunity to work on some cool stuff. Other than back-stage stuff that I can't really show here, like work on their SDKs, I also worked on the login and sign up pages for the website.

The pages were built with React, Styled Components, and Typescript, and they were integrated with a Django backend.

I also developed a few email templates, which are used in the login, login recovery, sign up and code verification steps.

# Challenges

A big challenge was putting the house in order when it came to email templating. There were a lot of different templates, and they were all over the place. I had to create a new system for email templating, and also create a new set of templates that would be used in the new login and sign up flows. I organized all templates into reusable snippets, and created a new system for templating, which was based on a custom Django template tag.

On the front-end side of things, the code was actually pretty straight forward. The Giphy team was one of the strongest I've ever worked with, and things were very well organized. I just had to follow the design specs and integrate the pages with the backend.

The biggest challenge in the front-end was actually styling everything! As you can imagine, Giphy is has very rich branding, and it was a challenge to get everything to look right, not to mention the plethora of animations. All in all, it was probably the most fun I've had while coding professionally!

# Final Thoughts

I am very proud of the work I did at Giphy, and I am very grateful for the opportunity to work with such a talented team. I hope I can work with them again in the future!

Sadly my stay there was short lived, as I was invited to join the team at LogRock, which was a great opportunity to get back at working at an early stage startup and building something up form scratch. And also to work with few friends and former colleagues.
