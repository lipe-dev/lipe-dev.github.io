# Digital Garden

This website is my digital garden - a personal wiki and collection of interconnected notes. Unlike a traditional blog with chronological posts, a digital garden grows organically over time.

## What is a Digital Garden?

A digital garden is:
- **Non-linear** - Notes connect to each other through [[wikilinks]], not just by date
- **Always growing** - Notes start as seedlings and mature over time
- **Personal** - It's my knowledge base, not optimized for SEO or views
- **Interconnected** - Ideas link to related ideas through backlinks

## Growth Stages

Notes in this garden have growth indicators:
- 🌱 **Seedling** - New, rough ideas
- 🌿 **Budding** - Developing, has some content
- 🌲 **Evergreen** - Mature, well-developed

## Tech Stack

This garden is built with:
- [[sveltekit]] - The framework
- [[svelte]] - UI components
- [[typescript]] - Type safety
- [[tailwind-css]] - Styling
- [[d3-force]] - Graph visualization
- mdsvex - Markdown processing with Svelte components

## Features

### Graph Visualization
The [[graph]] shows how notes connect to each other, making it easy to explore relationships.

### Wikilinks
Notes link to each other using `[[wikilinks]]` syntax, creating a web of knowledge.

### Backlinks
Each note shows what other notes link to it, revealing unexpected connections.

### Tags
Notes are tagged for additional organization and discovery.

## Why Build My Own?

I wanted full control over the experience and to learn by building. It's also a fun way to combine my interests in:
- [[svelte]] and [[sveltekit]]
- Information architecture
- Personal knowledge management
- Web development
