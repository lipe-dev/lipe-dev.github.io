# Maker

I enjoy building things - both physical and digital. There's something deeply satisfying about taking raw materials or components and creating something functional and personal.

## Current Projects

### [[dactyl-manuform|Dactyl Manuform Keyboard]]
Building an ergonomic split mechanical keyboard from scratch. A project that combines [[3d-printing]], [[electronics]], and firmware programming.

### [[opengrid|OpenGrid Organization System]]
A modular organization system inspired by Gridfinity, designed for organizing workshop tools and components.

## Skills & Tools

### 3D Printing
[[3d-printing]] is essential for maker projects. I use FDM printing for functional parts, enclosures, and prototypes.

### Electronics
[[electronics]] knowledge for wiring, soldering, and understanding circuits.

### Woodworking
[[woodworking]] for larger projects and custom enclosures.

### Software
Firmware programming, CAD modeling, and design software.

## Philosophy

I prefer projects that:
- Solve a real problem I have
- Teach me something new
- Are documented well enough to share with others
- Can be iterated and improved over time
