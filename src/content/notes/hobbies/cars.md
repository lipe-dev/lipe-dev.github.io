# Cars

I've always been passionate about cars - not just driving them, but understanding how they work, modifying them, and keeping older vehicles alive. There's something deeply satisfying about wrenching on a car and making it your own.

## My Fleet

### [[Toyota Bandeirante]]
My pride and joy - a Brazilian-built Toyota Land Cruiser variant with a Mercedes-Benz diesel engine. This is my project vehicle for off-roading, camping, and eventually a mobile office setup.

### [[Chevette]]
My drift project car. A classic Brazilian GM compact that I'm building for track days and drift events.

### [[GM Classic]]
My daily driver and car audio project. A reliable sedan that I've upgraded with a custom sound system.

### [[Toyota Corolla Hybrid]]
The practical family car. Efficient and reliable transportation.
