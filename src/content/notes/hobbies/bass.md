# Bass & Music

Playing bass guitar has been a long-standing hobby. There's something unique about the bass's role in music - you're the bridge between rhythm and harmony, providing the foundation that everything else builds on.

## My Setup

### Bass Guitars
- Primary bass for practice and playing
- Backup/project bass

### Amplification
- Practice amp for home use
- Headphone setup for quiet practice

### Effects
- Keeping it simple - bass often sounds best clean
- Compression for consistency
- Light overdrive for some styles

## Playing Style

I gravitate toward:
- **Fingerstyle** - Classic bass tone
- **Groove-based music** - Funk, R&B, soul
- **Rock** - Classic rock bass lines
- **Brazilian music** - MPB, bossa nova

## Learning Journey

### What I'm Working On
- Improving time feel and groove
- Learning songs by ear
- Music theory for bass
- Slap technique basics

### Resources
- Online lessons and courses
- Transcribing songs
- Playing along with records
- Occasional jam sessions

## The Gear Rabbit Hole

It's easy to focus on gear instead of practice. I try to keep focused on:
- Playing what I have
- Only upgrading when current gear is genuinely limiting
- Practice time over gear time

## Connection to Other Hobbies

Understanding [[electronics]] helps with:
- Basic pedal maintenance

### Car Audio
[[cars|Car audio]] projects give me appreciation for:

## Goals
