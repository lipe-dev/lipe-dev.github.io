# Gaming

Gaming has been a constant companion throughout my life. From early PC gaming to modern consoles, I've always enjoyed the interactive storytelling, problem-solving, and pure fun that games provide.

## My Gaming Setup

### [[Gaming PC]]
My primary gaming platform. A custom-built PC that handles modern games and doubles as my development workstation.

### [[Gaming on Linux]]
I primarily game on Linux, which has become surprisingly viable thanks to Proton and the Steam Deck driving improvements.

### Consoles
- Nintendo Switch - for Nintendo exclusives and portable gaming
- Older consoles in the collection

## [[Game Collection]]

I maintain a collection of games across various platforms, with a focus on games I actually play rather than just collecting for collecting's sake.

## Favorite Genres

- **RPGs** - Love deep stories and character progression
- **Strategy** - Both real-time and turn-based
- **Metroidvanias** - Exploration and ability-gated progression
- **Roguelikes/lites** - High replayability
- **Racing/Driving** - Connects to my [[cars]] hobby

## Gaming With Family

Gaming bridges age gaps. [[Terraria]] is the perfect example: 800+ hours across playthroughs with my brother (10 years younger) and now our little sister (20 years younger). Finding something a 33, 23, and 13 year old can all enjoy together isn't easy, but digging tunnels and fighting bosses works.

## Gaming Philosophy

I tend to prefer single-player experiences over multiplayer, with exceptions for co-op with family and close friends. I enjoy games that respect my time and offer meaningful progression. Quality over quantity. I'd rather finish fewer games than have a massive backlog of unfinished ones (though the backlog is real).
