# 3D Printing

3D printing has become an essential tool in my maker workflow. What started as a curiosity has become a go-to method for creating custom parts, prototypes, and practical objects.

## My Setup

### Printer
Running an FDM (Fused Deposition Modeling) printer - the most common and practical type for hobbyist use. FDM works by melting plastic filament and depositing it layer by layer.

### Slicing Software
Using modern slicing software to convert 3D models into printer instructions (G-code). The slicer settings make a huge difference in print quality.

### Materials
- **PLA** - Easy to print, good for prototypes and decorative items
- **PETG** - Stronger, more heat resistant, my go-to for functional parts
- **TPU** - Flexible material for gaskets and grips
- **ABS** - When heat resistance is critical

## What I Print

### Functional Parts
- [[opengrid]] organization bins
- Car mounts and holders
- Tool holders
- [[dactyl-manuform]] keyboard case
- Cable management
- Replacement parts for broken items

### Prototypes
- Testing designs before committing to other materials
- Iterating on fit and form
- Proof of concept parts

### Projects
- [[bandeirante-camping]] accessories
- [[classic-sound-system]] mounts
- Custom enclosures for [[electronics]] projects

## Design Workflow

1. **Identify the need** - What problem am I solving?
2. **Measure carefully** - Calipers are essential
3. **Design in CAD** - Fusion 360 or OpenSCAD
4. **Export and slice** - Configure print settings
5. **Print prototype** - Test fit and function
6. **Iterate** - Adjust design as needed
7. **Print final version** - Use appropriate material

## Tips I've Learned

- **Bed leveling is everything** - Get it right, or nothing else matters
- **Design for printing** - Consider overhangs, support needs, layer orientation
- **Temperature matters** - Ambient temperature affects print quality
- **Calibrate regularly** - E-steps, flow rate, temperature tower
- **Dry your filament** - Moisture is the enemy of quality prints
