# OpenGrid Organization System

A modular organization system for workshop and desk organization, inspired by the Gridfinity system.

## What is OpenGrid?

OpenGrid is a system of interlocking baseplates and bins that snap together to create organized storage. The modular nature means you can:
- Rearrange as needs change
- Create custom bins for specific items
- Scale from small desk organizers to full workshop storage

## Why Build It?

Organization systems are expensive to buy, and they never quite fit what you need. With [[3d-printing]], I can create exactly the bins I need for my specific tools and components.

## Components

### Baseplates
The foundation that bins snap into:
- Various sizes (1x1 up to large workshop plates)
- Can be screwed to surfaces
- Magnetic options for metal surfaces

### Bins
Storage containers that snap into baseplates:
- Standard rectangular bins in various heights
- Custom bins for specific tools
- Dividers for small components
- Label holders

### Specialized Holders
Custom designs for specific items:
- Screwdriver holders
- Hex key racks
- Soldering iron holder
- Component storage with lids

## My Implementation

### Workshop Organization
- Bins for electronic components (resistors, caps, ICs)
- Holders for hand tools
- Soldering station organization

### Desk Organization
- Cable management bins
- Pen and pencil holders
- USB drive storage

## Design Process

1. Measure items to store
2. Design bin in CAD (Fusion 360 or OpenSCAD)
3. Print prototype
4. Iterate on fit
5. Print final version
