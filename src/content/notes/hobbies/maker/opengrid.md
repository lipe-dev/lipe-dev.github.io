# OpenGrid Organization System

3D printed modular organization. Similar concept to [[Gridfinity]] but a different system. Baseplates and bins that snap together, fully customizable.

## Planned Setups

### Gaming Room
Controllers, headsets, cables - all the gaming accessories that currently live in a drawer or scattered around the desk. The goal is a clean display/storage solution near the [[Gaming PC]] setup.

### Workshop
Hand tools, [[Electronics]] components, 3D printing accessories. Everything currently in random boxes and drawers will get proper homes.

## Why OpenGrid Over Gridfinity?

Different grid sizing and design philosophy. I'm doing both - [[Gridfinity]] for some applications, OpenGrid for others. Whatever fits the specific use case better.

## Current Status

Printing baseplates and bins on the [[Bambu Lab A1]]. It's an ongoing project that grows as I identify what needs organizing.
