# Bambu Lab A1

My 3D printer. The one I bought because "I'll just send the [[Dactyl Manuform]] files to a print farm" and then thought "why pay someone when I could own the machine?"

## Why A1

The A1 is a bedslinger (bed moves Y, head moves X) unlike the coreXY P1/X1 series. Simpler, more affordable, still Bambu quality.

It's magic. Works flawlessly out of the box. Coming from stories of Ender 3 struggles and constant calibration, this thing just... prints.

## What I Print

- [[Dactyl Manuform]] keyboard case (0.08mm layer height, matte black)
- [[OpenGrid]] organization bins
- [[Gridfinity]] baseplates and bins
- [[Underware]] desk management parts
- Random functional prints as needed
