# Gridfinity

The popular modular organization system designed by Zack Freedman. 3D printed baseplates and bins on a standardized grid.

## What It Is

A standardized system where:
- Baseplates use a 42mm grid
- Bins snap into the grid in various sizes (1x1, 2x1, 3x2, etc.)
- Huge community library of designs on Printables/Thingiverse
- Easy to design custom bins that fit the ecosystem

## Why Gridfinity

The standardization is the killer feature. Thousands of pre-made designs for specific tools, components, and use cases. Don't have to design everything from scratch - just find what you need and print it.

## vs OpenGrid

Using both [[OpenGrid]] and Gridfinity depending on the application. Different grid sizes and design approaches suit different needs.
