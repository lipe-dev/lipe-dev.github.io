# Electronics

I went to tech school for telecom, and a good chunk of that was electronics fundamentals. Never worked with it professionally, but the knowledge bleeds into almost every hobby I have.

## Background

Telecom tech school gave me the foundations - soldering, reading schematics, understanding circuits, basic troubleshooting. It's the kind of education that pays dividends across everything else I do even if I never got paid for electronics work specifically.

## Projects

### Automotive Electrical

**[[Toyota Bandeirante]] Full Rewire**

Redid all the electrics on my '89 Bandeirante. This was actually a joy because it's such a simple old truck - there are a grand total of 32 electrical connections in the entire vehicle. Modern cars have thousands of wires and dozens of computers. The Bandeirante? You can trace the whole system on a napkin.

The truck came with all original manuals, so I had factory documentation for everything. No guessing, no forum hunting.

**[[GM Classic]] Audio**

Wiring for the [[Classic Sound System]] - amplifiers, speakers, head unit, all the connections.

### Arduino Projects

**[[Dactyl Manuform]] Keyboard**

The hand-wiring and matrix setup for the keyboard build. Diodes, controller wiring, the works.

**GameCube to 3DS Adapter**

A controller adapter project that's currently sitting at about 60% done. It works on the breadboard, just needs to be finished and housed properly. Classic project limbo.

### House Electrical

Redid the electrics in my dad's house once. Residential wiring is straightforward once you understand the fundamentals, and it's satisfying work when you're not paying an electrician's rates.

## Tools

Basic stuff, nothing fancy:
- Soldering iron
- Multimeter
- Wire strippers and cutters
- Various hand tools
- Breadboards and jumper wires for prototyping

I don't have an oscilloscope or hot air station. Someday, maybe. The basics get most jobs done.

## Future Projects

### RGB Office/Game Room
Proper lighting setup for the workspace. Probably LED strips, maybe some ambient bias lighting behind monitors.

### Under-Desk Connectivity Hub
A proper setup to manage all the cables and connections at my desk. Power, USB, audio - one clean system instead of the current cable spaghetti.

### Corsair K90 Refurbishment
My beloved 10-year-old K90 could use some love. Clean it properly, maybe replace some switches, keep it running for another decade.
