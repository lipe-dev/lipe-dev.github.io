# Woodworking

Woodworking complements my other maker hobbies by enabling projects at scales and with materials that 3D printing can't match. There's also something satisfying about working with a natural material.

## Current Projects

### Desk Build
Custom desk designed for my workspace:
- Solid wood top
- Cable management built-in
- Space for monitors and equipment
- Ergonomic height

### Shelving
Custom shelving for organization and display:
- Floating shelves
- Workshop storage
- Book shelves

## Tools

### Hand Tools
- Chisels
- Hand planes
- Measuring and marking tools
- Clamps (never enough clamps)

### Power Tools
- Circular saw
- Drill/driver
- Orbital sander
- Router (future)

## Skills I'm Developing

- Joinery basics
- Finishing techniques
- Design for wood movement
- Working with limited space

## Connection to Other Projects

### Car Projects
- [[classic-sound-system]] subwoofer enclosure
- [[bandeirante-sound-system]] speaker pods
- Interior panels

### Organization
- Drawer systems for [[bandeirante-camping]]
- Workshop organization
- [[opengrid]] integration with wooden surfaces

### Furniture

- Shelving for [[game-collection]] display

## Learning Resources

- YouTube woodworking channels
- Local maker spaces
- Books on joinery and design
- Trial and error (mostly error at first)

## Philosophy

Starting with simple projects and building skills gradually. Better to have a well-made simple piece than a poorly made complex one. Each project teaches something for the next one.
