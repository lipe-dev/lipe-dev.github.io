# Hardware

Computer hardware and building systems has been an interest since I first opened up a computer as a kid. Understanding how the physical machines work makes me a better developer.

## PC Building

### [[Gaming PC]]
My current build serves as both gaming rig and development workstation. Built it myself, choosing components for the right balance of performance, noise, and value.

### Building Philosophy
- Research components thoroughly
- Don't overspend on marginal gains
- Plan for upgradability
- Cable management matters
- Good airflow is essential

## Interests

### CPUs & Architecture
- Understanding performance characteristics
- Architecture differences (x86, ARM)
- How CPU design affects software

### GPUs
- Graphics processing and compute
- CUDA/OpenCL basics
- GPU acceleration for development tasks

### Storage
- SSD vs HDD use cases
- NVMe performance
- Data storage and backup

### Networking
- Home network setup
- Understanding protocols
- Performance optimization

## DIY Repair & Upgrade

- Laptop upgrades (RAM, storage)
- Desktop maintenance
- Diagnosing hardware issues
- Thermal paste replacement
