# Gaming PC

Not messing around here. This rig handles everything from development work to fighting modded Terraria bosses with every difficulty mod enabled simultaneously.

## Current Build

| Component | Model |
|-----------|-------|
| CPU | AMD Ryzen 9 9950X3D |
| GPU | MSI RTX 5080 |
| RAM | 64GB DDR5 Corsair Dominator Titanium |
| Motherboard | ASUS B890E-E Gaming WiFi |
| Case | Lian Li O11D RGB |
| PSU | Lian Li Edge |
| Fans | Lian Li Wireless LCD fans |
| Cooling | Air for now, custom loop planned |
| Keyboard | Corsair K95 (the OG, 10+ years old) |

The 9950X3D with the 3D V-cache is a gaming monster. Combined with the 5080, there's not much this thing can't handle.

## The RGB Situation

Full Lian Li aesthetic right now - the O11D showcase case, wireless LCD fans with the little screens, matching Edge PSU. Looks great.

**But** - the LCD fans have been disappointing. No OpenRGB support, and the L-Connect 3 beta that's supposed to handle integration is garbage. I have L-Connect controlling everything instead of the other way around, and it doesn't play nice with other RGB ecosystems.

At least the ASUS motherboard and the O11D case use actual ARGB with standard headers, not proprietary wireless nonsense. Small victories.

Might go back to a full Corsair build like I originally planned. When I do the custom water cooling loop, I'll probably switch to Corsair everything - at least iCUE talks to itself properly.

## Linux Gaming

Tried [[Gaming on Linux]] with both OmArchy and Bazzite. Both mostly work, but edge cases push me back to Windows.

Case in point: modded Terraria with my brother. We're talking:
- Calamity mod
- Death mode
- Eternity mode
- Fargo's mods
- All at once

When you're fighting Exo Mech bosses in that configuration, one frame of lag and you're dead. The Linux setups have micro-stutters that are unacceptable for that level of difficulty.

So it's dual-boot reality for now. Linux for most things, Windows when Proton can't quite get there.

## Future: Custom Water Loop

The next big project. Planning a full custom loop - CPU and GPU, probably hard tubing because if you're going to do it, do it right.

Going Corsair for the loop components so everything integrates with iCUE. That'll probably mean swapping out the Lian Li fans too. One ecosystem to rule them all.
