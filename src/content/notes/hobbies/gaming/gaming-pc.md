# Gaming PC

My custom-built gaming PC that serves dual duty as both a gaming rig and a development workstation.

## Current Build

The philosophy behind this build was balance - enough power for modern games at high settings while being quiet and efficient.

### Components

| Component | Model |
|-----------|-------|
| CPU | AMD Ryzen |
| GPU | NVIDIA GeForce RTX |
| RAM | 32GB DDR4 |
| Storage | NVMe SSD + HDD for games |
| Case | Mid-tower ATX |
| Cooling | Tower air cooler |
| PSU | 80+ Gold modular |

### Peripherals
- Mechanical keyboard ([[dactyl-manuform]] for work, standard for gaming)
- Quality gaming mouse
- 1440p high refresh monitor
- Good headphones + microphone

## Operating System

Running [[gaming-linux|Linux]] as my primary OS, with Windows available for the few games that don't work well with Proton.

## Building Philosophy

I prefer building my own PCs because:
- Better value for money
- Exactly the components I want
- Learning experience
- Easier to upgrade individual parts
- Fun!

## Upgrade Path

Current considerations for future upgrades:
- Monitor upgrade (4K or ultrawide)
- GPU upgrade when prices normalize
- More NVMe storage
