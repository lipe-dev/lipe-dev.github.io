# Game Collection

A curated list of games in my collection and my thoughts on them. This isn't meant to be comprehensive - just games I've found notable or want to remember.

## The Backlog

The eternal struggle. Games I own and want to play but haven't gotten to:
- *(It's a long list)*

## Completed

Games I've finished (rolled credits or completed to my satisfaction):
- *(Building this list)*

## Collection Philosophy

I try to:
- Buy games I'll actually play, not just collect
- Wait for sales on games I'm not urgent about
- Support indie developers when possible
- Avoid subscription services (prefer ownership)
- Play games, not just acquire them
