# Terraria

800+ hours between vanilla and modded. And counting.

## Why Terraria

It's the perfect game for maker-minded people. Build, explore, craft, fight bosses, optimize your setup, repeat. The difficulty curve respects hardcore gamers while still being approachable. Every playthrough feels different because there's so much to discover and so many ways to approach progression.

Re-Logic keeps releasing updates years after they "finished" the game. Every time they say "this is the last one" and then drop another massive content patch. The 2025 update just came out and I HAD to go back.

## The Family Connection

This is where Terraria gets special.

Me (33), my brother (23), and now our little sister (13) play together. That's a 20-year age gap between me and her, 10 years between each of us. Finding something we can all enjoy together isn't easy.

Terraria works. We've done multiple playthroughs over the years - me and my brother first, and now the party has grown. She's learning the ropes, we're helping her gear up, and we're all having a blast.

There's something nice about having a game that bridges those gaps. No matter how different our lives are at these ages, we can all dig tunnels, fight bosses, and argue about base design together.

## The Modded Rabbit Hole

Vanilla is great, but the modding scene is insane. Calamity, Thorium, quality-of-life mods - there's basically infinite content if you want it. Some of my 800 hours are definitely from modded runs that added entire new progression systems.
