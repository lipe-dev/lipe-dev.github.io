# GM Classic (2010)

my first car
bought from my grandfather about 10 years ago
2010 chevrolet classic - successor to the corsa/corsa classic, kind of a celta sedan
drove it daily for years
moved across the country a couple of times in it (stories for another note)
was the scout vehicle during the [[Chevette]] heist - dad drove it as our headlights
now my backup car, kept in memory of my grandfather
[[Toyota Corolla Hybrid]] is now my daily
also my car audio project - [[Classic Sound System]]
