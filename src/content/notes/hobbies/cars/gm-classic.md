# GM Classic (2010)

The Chevrolet Classic (also known as Corsa Classic in some markets) is a compact sedan that served as my daily driver. It's become my car audio project car where I experiment with speaker placement, amplifiers, and sound tuning.

## About the Classic

The Classic is a practical, reliable sedan that's perfect for daily driving and commuting. Its relatively quiet cabin makes it a good platform for a car audio build.

Key specs:
- **Engine**: GM 1.0L VHC-E Flex
- **Transmission**: 5-speed manual
- **Body Style**: 4-door sedan
