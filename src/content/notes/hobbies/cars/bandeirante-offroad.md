# Bandeirante Off-Road Preparation

Preparing the [[toyota-bandeirante]] for serious off-road capability while maintaining reliability.

## Philosophy

The Bandeirante is already capable off-road from the factory. The goal isn't to build a rock crawler, but to improve capability and recovery options while keeping the vehicle reliable and maintainable.

## Planned Modifications

### Tires & Wheels
- All-terrain tires (good balance of on/off-road)
- Proper sizing for clearance
- Full-size spare

### Suspension
- Quality shock absorbers
- Possibly lift for additional clearance
- Maintaining proper geometry

### Protection
- Skid plates for vulnerable components
- Rock sliders for body protection
- Front bumper with recovery points

### Recovery
- Front and rear recovery points
- Winch consideration (front)
- Hi-lift jack mounts
- Recovery board storage

### Lighting
- Quality LED headlights
- Auxiliary driving lights
- Work lights for recovery/camp

### Mechanical
- Engine breather extension (for water crossing)
- Diff breathers extension
- Clutch fan inspection/upgrade

## Learning

Part of this is also about learning vehicle recovery techniques and off-road driving skills. No point in having a capable vehicle without the skills to use it safely.
