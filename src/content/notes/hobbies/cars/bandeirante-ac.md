# Bandeirante Air Conditioning Installation

Adding air conditioning to the [[toyota-bandeirante]] for comfort in the Brazilian heat.

## The Need

Brazil is hot. Really hot. The Bandeirante's cab can become unbearable in summer, especially in traffic. AC is essential for any serious use of this vehicle.

## Considerations

### Compressor
- Need a compressor compatible with the OM-364 diesel engine
- Looking at universal mounting brackets
- Must handle R134a refrigerant

### Evaporator & Condenser
- Under-dash evaporator unit to fit the cabin
- Condenser placement in front of radiator
- Must not overheat the engine

### Electrical
- The Bandeirante's electrical system is basic
- May need alternator upgrade for AC load
- Wiring for compressor clutch and controls

## Research

- Universal AC kits designed for older vehicles
- Community solutions from other Bandeirante owners
- Professional installation vs DIY

## Status

Research phase - determining best approach for this specific vehicle.
