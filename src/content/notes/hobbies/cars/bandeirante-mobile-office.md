# Bandeirante Mobile Office Setup

Setting up the [[toyota-bandeirante]] to work as a mobile office for remote work from anywhere.

## The Dream

As a remote software developer, the idea of working from a scenic overlook, a quiet forest, or a beachside parking spot is incredibly appealing. The Bandeirante could be the perfect platform for this.

## Requirements

### Connectivity
- Mobile hotspot with good external antenna
- Signal booster for weak coverage areas
- Starlink as backup option (future)

### Power
- Sufficient battery capacity for laptop work
- Solar charging capability
- Clean power (sine wave inverter)
- Multiple work sessions without running engine

### Workspace
- Stable surface for laptop
- Comfortable seating position
- Shade/cover from elements
- Good ventilation
- **Quick release steering wheel** - remove the wheel to free up cabin space (see [[Bandeirante Power Steering]] for the custom hub plan)

### Comfort
- [[bandeirante-ac]] becomes even more important
- Ergonomic setup for extended work
- Phone/tablet mounting

## Technical Needs

For software development:
- Reliable internet (min 10Mbps up/down)
- Power for laptop (8+ hours)
- Secondary monitor capability
- Video call capable setup

## Challenges

- Finding reliable cell coverage in remote areas
- Battery capacity vs weight tradeoff
- Heat management for electronics
- Weather protection while working
