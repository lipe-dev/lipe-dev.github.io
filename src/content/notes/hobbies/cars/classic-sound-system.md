# GM Classic Sound System Build

My car audio project in the [[gm-classic]], focused on achieving great sound quality for daily listening.

## Goals

- Excellent sound quality for various genres
- Good imaging and soundstage
- Clean, powerful bass without rattles
- Daily driver friendly (no trunk-filling setups)

## System Design

### Source
- Quality head unit with good DAC
- Bluetooth aptX or LDAC support
- USB for high-quality files
- Time alignment and EQ capability

### Front Stage
The most important part of the system:
- Component speakers (6.5" + tweeters)
- Proper tweeter placement for imaging
- Solid door deadening
- Passive or active crossover

### Subwoofer
- Modest 10" or 12" in sealed enclosure
- Focused on musical bass, not SPL
- Trunk-mounted with pass-through

### Amplification
- 4-channel for front stage
- Mono amp for subwoofer
- Clean, efficient operation
- Properly fused and wired

### Sound Treatment
- Door deadening (Dynamat or similar)
- Floor deadening in key areas
- Reduce rattles and resonances
