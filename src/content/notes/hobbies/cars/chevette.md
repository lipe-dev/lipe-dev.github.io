# Chevette (Drift Build)

The Chevrolet Chevette was produced in Brazil from 1973 to 1993 and became an icon of Brazilian automotive culture. My Chevette is being built as a dedicated drift car for track days and events.

The Brazilian Chevette is a rear-wheel-drive compact car with a longitudinally-mounted engine, making it perfect for drifting. It's lightweight, parts are abundant and cheap, and the community is very active.

Key specs:

## Drifting Goals

I'm still learning to drift, so the car will grow with my skills. The plan is to start with the stock engine and focus on seat time, then upgrade power as my car control improves.
