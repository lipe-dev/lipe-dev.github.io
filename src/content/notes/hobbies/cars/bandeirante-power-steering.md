# Bandeirante Power Steering Conversion

Adding power steering to the [[toyota-bandeirante]] to make it more comfortable for daily driving and long trips.

## The Challenge

The Bandeirante was designed in an era when power steering wasn't common, especially for off-road vehicles. While the heavy steering provides good feedback off-road, it can be tiring in city traffic and parking situations.

## Options

### Hydraulic Power Steering
The traditional approach using a hydraulic pump driven by the engine:
- Proven technology
- Good feel and feedback
- Requires pump, reservoir, lines, and steering box modification
- Some power loss from engine-driven pump

### Electric Power Steering (EPS)
Modern approach using an electric motor:
- No hydraulic fluid to leak
- Can be more efficient
- Requires compatible steering column or rack
- May need custom fabrication

## Research

- Looking into conversion kits available in Brazil
- Community forums with Bandeirante owners who've done this
- Compatibility with existing steering box

## Status

Planning phase - gathering information and quotes.
