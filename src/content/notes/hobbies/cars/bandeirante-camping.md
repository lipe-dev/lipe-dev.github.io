# Bandeirante Camping & Overlanding Setup

Transforming the [[toyota-bandeirante]] into a capable overlanding and camping vehicle.

## Vision

The goal is to have a self-sufficient vehicle that can handle multi-day trips to remote areas. Not a full expedition build, but capable of comfortable wilderness camping.

## Planned Features

### Sleeping
- Rooftop tent or truck bed tent
- Sleeping platform in the bed
- Quality sleeping pad/mattress

### Cooking
- Portable stove setup
- Basic cookware kit
- Cooler/fridge solution
- Water storage and filtration

### Power
- Dual battery system
- Solar panel capability
- USB and 12V outlets
- Battery monitor

### Storage
- Drawer system in truck bed
- Secure storage for valuables
- Organized equipment storage

### Lighting
- LED camp lights
- Under-vehicle lighting for setup
- Reading lights

### Recovery Gear
- Hi-lift jack
- Recovery boards
- Straps and shackles
- Basic tool kit
- Spare parts

## Approach

Taking this step by step, starting with the basics and expanding based on actual use and needs. Better to understand what I actually need through experience than to over-build.
