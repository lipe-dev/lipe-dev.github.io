# Toyota Bandeirante (1989)

The Toyota Bandeirante is a Brazilian-made variant of the Toyota Land Cruiser, produced from 1958 to 2001. My 1989 model is powered by a Mercedes-Benz OM-364 4-cylinder diesel engine, which is incredibly reliable and relatively easy to work on.

## About the Bandeirante

The name "Bandeirante" comes from the Brazilian pioneers who explored the interior of Brazil in the 17th and 18th centuries. It's a fitting name for a vehicle built for adventure and exploration.

Key specs:
- **Engine**: Mercedes-Benz OM-364 4.0L Diesel
- **Transmission**: 4-speed manual
- **Transfer Case**: 2-speed (4x4)
- **Body Style**: Long wheelbase pickup

## Current State

The truck is in running condition but needs work in several areas to become the adventure vehicle I envision.

## Why I Love It

There's something special about driving a vehicle that's been discontinued for over 20 years. Every trip feels like an adventure, and the mechanical simplicity means I can fix most issues myself with basic tools. It connects me to a tradition of Brazilian engineering and Toyota's legendary reliability.
