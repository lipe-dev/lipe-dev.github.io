# Toyota Bandeirante (1989)

The Toyota Bandeirante is a Brazilian-made variant of the Toyota Land Cruiser, produced from 1958 to 2001. My 1989 model is powered by a Mercedes-Benz OM-364 4-cylinder diesel engine, which is incredibly reliable and relatively easy to work on.

## About the Bandeirante

The name "Bandeirante" comes from the Brazilian pioneers who explored the interior of Brazil in the 17th and 18th centuries. It's a fitting name for a vehicle built for adventure and exploration.

Key specs:
- **Engine**: Mercedes-Benz OM-364 4.0L Diesel
- **Transmission**: 4-speed manual
- **Transfer Case**: 3-setting (2x4, 4x4, 4x4 low aka "tractor mode")
- **Body Style**: Long wheelbase pickup

## Current State

The truck is in super pristine documentary condition. It came with all the original manuals - and I mean everything. Service manual, owner's manual, even the tag that used to hang on the rear-view mirror at the dealership.

The manuals have instructions for everything. I could rebuild the engine by following them step by step. No forum hunting, no guessing, just factory documentation.

I've already redone all the electrics. Here's the beautiful thing about old simple vehicles: there are a grand total of 32 electrical connections in the entire truck. That's it. Modern cars have thousands of wires and dozens of computers. The Bandeirante? You can trace the whole system on a napkin.

It's running and functional, but needs work in several areas to become the adventure vehicle I envision.

## Project Roadmap

### Done ✓
- [x] Electrical system rewire (all 32 connections!)
- [x] [[Bandeirante Power Steering]] - F350 pump, custom Henkell wheel, Mercedes 1113 pulley

## Why I Love It

There's something special about driving a vehicle that's been discontinued for over 20 years. Every trip feels like an adventure, and the mechanical simplicity means I can fix most issues myself with basic tools. It connects me to a tradition of Brazilian engineering and Toyota's legendary reliability.
