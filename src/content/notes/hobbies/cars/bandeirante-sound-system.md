# Bandeirante Sound System Build

Building a capable audio system for the [[toyota-bandeirante]] that can handle rough terrain while still sounding great.

## Unique Challenges

The Bandeirante presents unique challenges for car audio:
- **Vibration**: Off-road use means everything gets shaken
- **Dust**: The cab isn't sealed, dust gets everywhere
- **Electrical**: Basic 12V system with limited capacity
- **Space**: Unconventional cabin layout

## Design Goals

1. **Durability** - Must survive off-road abuse
2. **Simplicity** - Easy to troubleshoot in the field
3. **Quality** - Good sound for camping and overlanding
4. **Flexibility** - Bluetooth, AUX, USB connectivity

## Planned Components

### Head Unit
Looking for something with:
- Good Bluetooth connectivity
- Physical buttons (no touchscreen lag/durability issues)
- Short chassis for shallow dash

### Speakers
- Robust 6.5" components or coaxials
- Marine-grade options for durability
- Good efficiency (limited power available)

### Subwoofer
- Compact powered sub or small sealed enclosure
- Don't need competition-level bass, just warmth

### Amplification
- Single 4-channel amp to keep it simple
- Good efficiency to reduce electrical load

## Installation Considerations

- Custom door panels or kick panels for speakers
- Secure mounting for off-road
- Easily accessible fuse and connection points
- Consider vibration isolation mounts

## Status

Planning phase - deciding on components.
