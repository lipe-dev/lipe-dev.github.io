# Chevette Body Work Project

Preparing the [[chevette]] body for its drift build transformation.

## Current State

Like many older Brazilian cars, the Chevette has some rust and dents that need addressing before any serious build work.

## Body Work Roadmap

### Phase 1: Assessment
- Full body inspection
- Document all rust spots
- Identify structural concerns
- Measure and check alignment

### Phase 2: Rust Repair
- Cut out rusted sections
- Weld in patch panels
- Treat hidden rust areas
- Seam sealing

### Phase 3: Dent Repair
- Pull major dents
- Body filler work
- Block sanding
- Primer

### Phase 4: Prep for Paint/Wrap
- Final sanding
- Sealing
- Decision: paint or wrap?
- Color/design choice

## Considerations for Drift Build

- Weight reduction (delete unnecessary trim)
- Potential wide body kit fitment
- Access panels for cage integration
- Keeping it simple for inevitable drift damage

## DIY vs Professional

Planning to do assessment and basic prep myself, with professional help for:
- Serious rust repair welding
- Final paint work
