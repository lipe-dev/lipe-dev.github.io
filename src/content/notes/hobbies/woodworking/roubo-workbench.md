# Roubo Workbench

The project that's been waiting three years. A proper woodworking bench in the André Roubo tradition - thick top, solid legs, built to last generations.

## Why Roubo

A workbench isn't furniture. It's a tool. The Roubo design has survived centuries because it works: massive top that doesn't move, legs that can take a beating, and a design that lets you clamp work from any angle.

Plus, building a workbench with hand tools is the ultimate [[Woodworking]] bootstrap problem. You need a bench to build things... so you build a bench without one.

## Current Status

**In Progress - 3 years and counting**

The major laminations are done. Tops went to a mill a few months ago to plane the faces flat. Now it's joinery time.

## The Roadmap

### Phase 1: Prep
- [ ] Check wood glue supply (might need more)
- [ ] Square up the tops

### Phase 2: Leg Joinery
- [ ] Cut joinery on legs (3 vigas laminated together per leg)
- [ ] Cut mortises in legs for short stretchers
- [ ] Cut mortises in legs for long stretchers

### Phase 3: Stretchers
- [ ] Make tenons on short stretchers
- [ ] Make tenons on long stretchers
- [ ] Fit stretchers to legs (test assembly)
- [ ] Design wedge system for long stretchers (knockdown joint for disassembly)

### Phase 4: Top Attachment
- [ ] Decide attachment method:
  - Option A: Underscrew setup
  - Option B: Dado
  - Option C: Sliding dovetail
- [ ] Cut joinery for top attachment
- [ ] Test fit top to base

### Phase 5: Split Top
- [ ] Drill/route channels in the board that sits in the split top
- [ ] Fit and adjust

### Phase 6: Hardware
- [ ] Source leg vise hardware
- [ ] Source tail vise hardware (or design wooden alternative)
- [ ] Install vises

### Phase 7: Done
- [ ] Apply finish (or leave raw?)
- [ ] Move to shop
- [ ] Actually use it to build things

## Materials on Hand

- Tops: Laminated ✓, planed flat ✓
- Legs: 3 vigas glued per leg ✓
- Stretcher stock: Need to verify
- Wood glue: Check supply

## Design Decisions Still Open

**Top attachment:** Underscrews are easiest but least elegant. Sliding dovetails are the traditional flex. Dados are a middle ground. Need to decide based on tools available and patience level.

**Knockdown joinery:** Long stretchers with wedged tenons means the bench can be disassembled for transport. Smart given it's being built at grandma's farm but will live elsewhere.

## The Unlock

This bench unlocks everything:
- Shop setup becomes possible
- Future [[Woodworking]] projects have a proper work surface
- Custom bass build can begin
- [[Chevette]] might need wood jigs

Three years of chicken-egg dependency, solved with mortises and tenons.
