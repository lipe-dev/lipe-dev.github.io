# Safe Trace Café

Ever wonder where your coffee actually comes from? Like, really comes from - which farm, which field, which processing plants it passed through?

That's what Safe Trace Café does.

## The Product

A supermarket application for food product traceability. From warehouse to shelf, every step is tracked. For products like coffee, that means tracing all the way back to the specific farm field where the beans were planted.

## Who Uses It

This isn't some small-time operation. The app is used by **Pão de Açúcar** and **Carrefour** - two of the biggest retail chains in Brazil. When you're serving retailers at that scale, reliability isn't optional.

## What Gets Tracked

### Origin Tracing
For products like coffee, the system tracks the complete journey:
- The farm and specific field where it was grown
- Processing plants it passed through
- Transportation and handling
- Warehouse entry
- Shelf placement

When there's a recall or quality issue, you can pinpoint exactly which batch came from where.

### In-Store Transformations
The interesting part is tracking what happens inside the store. That ham in the deli case? The system tracks:
- When it entered inventory as a whole piece
- When it got sliced
- How it was repackaged
- Where it ended up

Partitioning and transformation tracking sounds mundane until you realize how critical it is for food safety.

## The Build

I was the sole developer. Built the whole thing, deployed it, and it's still in use by major retailers. There's something satisfying about building software that handles real-world logistics for companies that big.

## Why Traceability Matters

Food safety isn't abstract. When there's an E. coli outbreak or a contamination issue, being able to trace products back to their source saves lives. It's not glamorous work, but it matters.
