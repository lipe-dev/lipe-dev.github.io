# Repunzel

Let down your hair and let the agents find you.

## The Platform

Repunzel connects artists with agents and agencies for representation. Think of it as a matchmaking service for the talent industry - photographers, models, actors, performers of all kinds looking for professional representation.

Artists create profiles showcasing their portfolio:
- Photo galleries
- Previous work and credits
- Bio and specialties
- Contact preferences

Agents and agencies browse these profiles, and when they're interested, they reach out. It's about making the discovery process easier for both sides.

## What I Built

### Stripe Integration

Implemented the payment system using Stripe. Platform businesses have interesting payment flows - you're not just processing simple transactions, you're handling marketplace dynamics with multiple parties involved.

### Full CI/CD Automation

This is where I had the most fun. Set up completely automated deployment pipelines covering:
- Frontend deployments
- Backend deployments
- Google Cloud Functions
- Database migrations
- Digital Ocean infrastructure

Push to main, everything deploys. No manual steps, no "let me SSH into the server real quick." The kind of setup where you can ship on a Friday afternoon without fear (okay, maybe still a little fear).

## The Contract Life

This was a short-term contract - come in, build specific things, make sure they work, move on. Not every project needs to be a multi-year commitment. Sometimes you just need someone to come in, solve problems, and set things up properly.
