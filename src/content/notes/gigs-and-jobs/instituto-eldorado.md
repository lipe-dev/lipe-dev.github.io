# Instituto Eldorado

The place everyone from [[UNIFEI]] wanted to work at. Located right there in Campinas, doing R&D for major tech companies - it was the dream gig for fresh graduates.

## The Company

Instituto Eldorado is a research and development institute that partners with big tech companies on their Brazilian operations. When I was there, the main client was Motorola, and we were deep in [[Android]] OS customization work.

## What I Did

### Android OS Customization

Worked closely with Motorola on customizing Android for new phone launches. This isn't app development - it's lower level stuff, tweaking the OS itself for specific hardware configurations. When a new Motorola phone was about to hit the market, we were part of making sure the software worked properly on that specific device.

### Test Infrastructure

Built several test setups to collect data and diagnostics from mobile devices. One project I'm particularly proud of was an audio quality testing system for call performance. Measuring audio quality programmatically is trickier than it sounds - you need consistent test environments, proper signal analysis, and automated ways to detect issues that a human ear would catch.

### Device Catalog

Created a catalog system for over 3,000 devices to speed up testing workflows. When you're testing across that many device variants, you need good tooling to keep track of what's been tested, what failed, and what needs attention.

## Why I Left

Here's the thing: Eldorado is genuinely a great place to work. Good benefits, interesting projects, smart colleagues. But the work leaned heavily toward QA, testing, and analysis rather than building products from scratch.

I realized I'm the kind of developer who needs to be deeper in the code, building things, not just testing them. Nothing wrong with QA work - it's crucial - but it's not where my passion lies.

## The Dream That Wasn't

It's funny how the "dream job" you have as a student doesn't always match who you actually are as a professional. Eldorado taught me something important about myself: I need to be building, not just validating.
