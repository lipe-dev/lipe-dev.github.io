# Utyl Business Platforms

A freelance gig that taught me [[SEO]] is basically dark magic - but dark magic that works.

## The Project

Built a client website for a prominent player in the Brazilian medical industry. Can't disclose the specific client, but let's just say they're a big deal in their space. The site's main purpose was selling online courses - educational content for medical professionals.

## The SEO Challenge

The client's existing online presence was... not great. They were buried in search results, losing potential customers to competitors with better Google-fu.

My job wasn't just to build a pretty website - it was to build one that Google would actually show to people.

### The Result

**Ranked #1 on Google** for their target keywords.

Not page one. Not top three. Number one.

SEO success isn't guaranteed, but understanding the fundamentals - proper semantic [[HTML]], fast load times, mobile responsiveness, strategic content structure - gets you most of the way there. The rest is patience and iteration.

## Platform Integration

The site integrated with an online education platform for course sales. The flow had to be seamless - visitors browse courses, get interested, and purchase without friction. Any hiccup in that journey means lost sales.

## What I Learned

This project hammered home that a website isn't just about looking good. It's about being found, loading fast, converting visitors, and actually serving business goals. All the pretty designs in the world don't matter if nobody can find you.
