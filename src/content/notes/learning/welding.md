# Welding

Currently taking welding classes at SENAI. Learning new fabrication skills for multiple projects.

## Why Welding

- [[Chevette]] bodywork - cyberpunk nomad patchwork style
- [[Toyota Bandeirante]] roof rack (bagageiro)

Both projects need metalwork, and paying someone else to do it isn't the maker way.

## The Classes

### TIG (December 2025)

First class. Super fun. Finally learned how to use the welder I bought over two years ago. Yes, the machine sat there for two years waiting for me to learn how to use it properly. Classic maker move.

TIG is the precision process - clean welds, good for thinner materials, requires both hands and a foot pedal. It's like patting your head and rubbing your belly while threading a needle.

### MIG/MAG (Current)

Currently enrolled. Learning a different process - wire-fed, faster, more forgiving. Good for the heavier structural work the car projects will need.

### SMAW (Next Month)

Stick welding. The classic. Joining next month to round out the skill set.

## SENAI

SENAI (Serviço Nacional de Aprendizagem Industrial) is Brazil's industrial training network. They offer practical, hands-on courses in trades like welding, machining, and electrical work. The quality is solid and the facilities are well-equipped.

## Night School Life

Taking night classes on subjects completely unrelated to my day job has been a lot of fun. Also very tiring. But the courses are only two weeks each, so I've been able to sprinkle them around without taking away too much from family time.

There's something satisfying about learning with your hands after spending all day in front of a screen.

## Fun Side Effect: Noticing Bad Work Everywhere

New favorite term: **galvanic corrosion**.

Now I can't unsee it. The counterintuitive part: you'd think "might as well use stainless screws, they're almost as cheap and won't rust." Wrong. When you mix dissimilar metals, the more noble one (stainless) causes the less noble one (carbon steel) to corrode *faster*. The stainless screw becomes a little battery anode, and the carbon steel around it pays the price.

So that rusted-out hole around an otherwise pristine screw on a handrail or water fountain? That's galvanic corrosion. Point and laugh.

This is the curse of learning a trade - you start noticing every shortcut and mistake in the wild. Ignorance was bliss.
