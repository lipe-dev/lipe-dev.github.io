# Ongoing Projects

All the loose ends. The chickens and eggs. A clear picture of works in progress, excluding current job.

## Active - Actually Being Worked On

### [[Chevette]] - Drift Build
**Status:** Disassembly phase
- Internals removed
- Drivetrain coming out next
- Then bodywork (learning [[Welding]] for this)
- Currently at grandma's farm

**Next:** Remove drivetrain, start patching floor and rust

### [[Welding]] Classes
**Status:** Currently learning
- For Chevette bodywork
- For [[Toyota Bandeirante]] roof rack

**Next:** Keep practicing, apply to projects

### [[Planted Aquarium]]
**Status:** Running, always ongoing
- Fish acclimated and released
- DIY siphon overflow working
- Low-tech plants growing

**Next:** Arduino lighting automation, maybe CO2

### [[OpenGrid]] / [[Gridfinity]] Printing
**Status:** Ongoing
- Printing baseplates and bins as needed
- Gaming room setup planned
- Workshop setup planned

**Next:** Continue printing, design custom bins

## Waiting - Blocked on Parts/Time

### [[Dactyl Manuform]] Keyboard
**Status:** Waiting on parts
- Case printed (matte black, 0.08mm)
- Switches ready (Speed Silvers)
- Controller ready (RP2040 Pro Micro)
- **Waiting:** Switch PCBs from Keycapsss, per-key RGB LEDs

**Next:** Assemble when parts arrive

### [[Roubo Workbench]]
**Status:** Major components done, joinery phase next
- Tops glued up and planed ✓
- Legs glued up (from vigas) ✓
- **Needs:** Joinery, stretchers, top attachment, vise hardware

**Next:** Square up tops, cut leg mortises. Full roadmap in the note.

## Planned - Not Yet Started

### [[Gaming PC]] Custom Water Loop
**Status:** Planning
- Going Corsair ecosystem
- Probably replacing Lian Li fans
- Full CPU + GPU loop
- Hard tubing

**Next:** Research, budget, order parts

### [[Underware]] Desk Setup
**Status:** Planned
- Under-desk cable management
- USB hub mounting
- Power organization

**Next:** Design and print

### Shop Setup
**Status:** Room exists, not set up
- Room behind garage waiting to become workshop
- Needs the workbench first (chicken/egg)

**Next:** Finish workbench, then set up shop

## Toyota Bandeirante - Full Roadmap

See [[Toyota Bandeirante]] for complete list. Highlights:

**Done:**
- Electrical rewire ✓
- [[Bandeirante Power Steering]] ✓
- LED headlights, seatbelts, turn signals ✓

**Next up:**
- Horn fix
- Custom steering hub with quick release
- Caliper brake conversion

**Big items remaining:**
- Mechanical winch
- Snorkel
- [[Bandeirante Air Conditioning]]
- [[Bandeirante Camping Setup]]
- [[Bandeirante Sound System]]
- Roof rack (needs welding skills)

## Future/Someday

### Custom Bass Build
After the workbench is done. Design body, select wood, build from scratch.

### Aquarium Upgrades
- Arduino lighting automation
- CO2 injection system
- Actually use the refugium

### Bandeirante "Maybe" Items
- Turbo + intercooler
- Onboard air compressor
- 5-speed transmission (only if cheap one appears)

## The Chicken and Egg Summary

```
Workbench → needs shop space
Shop → needs workbench to build things
Chevette → needs welding skills
Welding → currently learning
Dactyl → needs parts (in transit)
Water loop → needs research + budget
Everything → needs time
Time → consumed by other projects
```
