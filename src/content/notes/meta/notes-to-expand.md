# Notes to Expand Next

A curated list of seedlings worth growing, balanced across hobbies, interests, and professional life.

## High Priority - Good Stories Waiting

### [[GM Classic]]
First car, bought from grandfather, driven for 10 years including cross-country moves. Now backup/memorial car. The story is there, just needs telling. Also the support vehicle for the [[Chevette]] heist.

### [[Classic Sound System]]
Car audio build that connects to [[Bass]], [[Woodworking]] (subwoofer enclosure), and [[Electronics]]. Good crossover project.

### [[Bandeirante Camping Setup]]
Clear vision, ties into the whole adventure vehicle concept. Wood flooring, storage systems, overlanding gear.

## Medium Priority - Fills Gaps

### [[React]] or [[TypeScript]]
Core professional tech stack. These are linked from many project notes but are empty placeholders. Should have at least basic content about experience and opinions.

### [[Game Collection]]
Balances the heavy car/maker content with gaming hobby. What games, what platforms, collecting philosophy.

### [[Bandeirante Mobile Office]]
The remote work dream - coding from scenic overlooks. Interesting concept that connects tech life with adventure hobby.

## Lower Priority - But Interesting

### [[Data Mining]]
Academic background, PSO research. Different from the hobby content.

### [[Welding]]
Just started learning. Note can grow with the skill.

### [[Bandeirante Sound System]]
SQ build planned. Can expand when planning gets more concrete.

## Tech Notes - Bulk Expansion

These are mostly empty placeholders that get linked from project notes. Could do a batch session to give them basic content:

- [[JavaScript]], [[Python]], [[Django]]
- [[CI/CD]], [[GitHub Actions]]
- [[SvelteKit]], [[Svelte]]
- [[Firebase]], [[Supabase]]

## Balance Check

Current budding notes lean heavily toward:
- ✓ Jobs/career (all 13 done)
- ✓ Cars (Chevette, Bandeirante, Power Steering)
- ✓ Maker (Dactyl, Woodworking, Electronics)
- ✓ Music (Bass)
- ✓ Gaming (Gaming PC, Gaming on Linux)
- ✓ New: Fishkeeping (Planted Aquarium)

Gaps to fill:
- Tech stack notes (professional tools)
- More gaming content (Game Collection)
- Education background (UNIFEI and UMD done, but Data Mining, CompSci empty)
